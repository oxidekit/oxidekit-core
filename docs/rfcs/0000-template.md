- Feature Name: `my_feature`
- Start Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- RFC PR: [oxidekit/oxidekit-core#0000](https://github.com/oxidekit/oxidekit-core/pull/0000)
- Tracking Issue: [oxidekit/oxidekit-core#0000](https://github.com/oxidekit/oxidekit-core/issues/0000)

# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

Focus on the problem, not the solution. Describe specific scenarios where this feature would be valuable.

# Guide-level Explanation

Explain the proposal as if it were already implemented and you were teaching it to an OxideKit user. This section should:

- Introduce new named concepts
- Explain the feature with examples
- Explain how users should think about this feature
- If applicable, provide migration guidance from existing patterns

For implementation-oriented RFCs, this section should explain how contributors should think about the change and give examples of its impact.

# Reference-level Explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented
- Corner cases are dissected by example

This section should return to the examples given in the previous section and explain the details that were glossed over.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Consider:

- Implementation cost, both in terms of code size and complexity
- Integration cost with other features
- Cost of teaching this to users
- Does this proposal contribute to overall complexity?

# Rationale and Alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
- If this is a language proposal, could this be done outside of the language?

# Prior Art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. Include:

- How other UI frameworks have solved this problem (Electron, Tauri, Slint, etc.)
- How other programming languages have solved similar problems
- Papers, blog posts, or other references

This section is intended to encourage you to think about other solutions and provide readers with a fuller picture.

# Unresolved Questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently?

# Future Possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the platform as a whole. This is a good place to "dump ideas" that are out of scope for the RFC but could be pursued later.

This section is optional but can be helpful for:

- Showing the bigger picture
- Identifying potential future work
- Understanding limitations of the current proposal

Note: If you cannot think of future possibilities, you may remove this section.
