# OxideKit: Investor One-Pager

> The Stable, Verified Application Platform for the Next Decade

---

## The Problem

**Enterprise desktop and internal tool development is broken.**

| Pain Point | Cost |
|------------|------|
| **Dependency churn** | Electron apps break every 6 months; Tauri still unstable |
| **Security theater** | No real capability enforcement; apps request everything |
| **Maintenance hell** | 5-year-old internal tools are unmaintainable |
| **Compliance gaps** | No standard SBOM, no verification, audit nightmares |
| **Platform fragmentation** | Different stacks for web, desktop, mobile |

**The result**: Enterprises spend millions maintaining brittle applications, or avoid building them altogether.

**Market reality**:
- 72% of enterprises have internal tools older than their frameworks
- Average Electron app requires major rewrite every 2-3 years
- Security teams have no visibility into desktop app behavior

---

## The Solution

**OxideKit: A Rust-native application platform with enforced stability and verification.**

### Core Value Proposition

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Native performance** | Rust core, no JavaScript runtime overhead |
| **Enforced capabilities** | Apps declare permissions, system enforces them |
| **Verified builds** | Attestation service proves what apps actually do |
| **10-year stability** | API compatibility commitments, LTS releases |
| **Web-compatible UI** | Use familiar web technologies for UI layer |

### Technical Differentiators

- **Capability-based security**: Applications cannot access what they don't declare
- **SBOM-first design**: Every build produces a complete software bill of materials
- **Reproducible builds**: Same code always produces same binary
- **Attestation chain**: Cryptographic proof of build provenance and permissions

---

## Market Wedge

**Initial target: Enterprise admin tools and internal applications.**

### Why This Wedge

| Factor | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|
| **Pain is acute** | Internal tools are where maintenance debt hurts most |
| **Decision makers accessible** | IT/DevOps teams make tool choices |
| **Security matters** | Admin tools touch sensitive systems |
| **Long lifecycle** | 5-10 year expected lifespan matches our stability promise |
| **Lower marketing cost** | B2B enterprise sales, not consumer acquisition |

### Expansion Path

```
Admin Tools -> Developer Tools -> Business Apps -> Consumer Apps
```

Each step expands TAM while leveraging enterprise credibility.

## Business Model

**Four revenue streams, all enterprise-aligned.**

| Stream | Target | Pricing | Year 3 Revenue |
|--------|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Enterprise Support** | Fortune 5000 | $25K-$250K/year | $8M ARR |
| **Attestation Service** | All shipping apps | $29-$5K/month | $4M ARR |
| **Marketplace Revenue** | Plugin/theme ecosystem | 15% rev share | $2M ARR |
| **Premium Plugins** | Enterprise-specific | $500-$5K/month | $1M ARR |

### Unit Economics

- **Support**: 90%+ gross margin
- **Attestation SaaS**: 80%+ gross margin
- **Marketplace**: 100% margin (platform fee)
- **Plugins**: 85%+ gross margin

### Revenue Projections

| Year | ARR | Key Milestone |
|------|-----|---------------|
| 1 | $500K | 20 enterprise customers |
| 2 | $3M | 100 enterprise customers, marketplace launch |
| 3 | $15M | 500 enterprise customers, attestation adoption |
| 5 | $50M | Platform standard for enterprise desktop |

## Competitive Moat

### Moat Components

| Moat | Durability | Defensibility |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Trademark/Brand** | Permanent | Legal protection prevents "OxideKit Pro" forks |
| **Compatibility standard** | High | "OxideKit Compatible" becomes the requirement |
| **Attestation network** | Very high | Verification is only valuable at scale |
| **Marketplace lock-in** | High | Ecosystem of verified plugins/themes |
| **Enterprise relationships** | High | Multi-year contracts, switching costs |

### Why Hard to Replicate

1. **Trust takes time**: Attestation value grows with history
2. **Ecosystem flywheel**: More apps -> more plugins -> more apps
3. **Enterprise validation**: Fortune 500 adoption signals credibility
4. **Rust expertise**: Deep systems programming talent is scarce
